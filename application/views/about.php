	My actual name is Victor Bobkov and I am a Developer & System Administrator.
	<br /><br />
	Essentially, I am a software developer, scientist, gamer and frequenter of many local restaurants.
	<br /><br />
	I am a firm believer in black magic, because <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">it is as real as the rock we consume air on</a>.
	<br /><br />
	This website functions as a repository for some of the ideas and tricks I have learned.
