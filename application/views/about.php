	What is up, I am VeeB. My actual name is Victor Bobkov and I am a webdev & sysadmin (web developer and system administrator).
	<br /><br />
	I am essentially a software developer, gamer and frequenter of many local restaurants.
	<br /><br />
	I am a firm believer in black magic, because <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">it is as real as the rock we consume air on</a>.
	<br /><br />
	This website functions as a repository for some of the ideas and tricks I have learned.
