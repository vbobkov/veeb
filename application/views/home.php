			The website is up and running.
			The very 1st tutorial I have written up (ever) is about the correct/elegant way to do <a target="_blank" href="/shenanigans/nested_cssmenu">multi-layered menus</a>.
			And by that I mean using the least lines of code and resources (CPU/RAM/hard drive space/bandwidth/etc) while utilizing just CSS and plain HTML.
			As a bonus, it includes instructions on <a target="_blank" href="/shenanigans/nested_cssmenu">how to make it mobile-friendly</a> with just ~15 lines of JQuery.
