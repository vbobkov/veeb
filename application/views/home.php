			The website is up and running.
			The very 1st tutorial I have written up (ever) is about the correct/elegant way to do <a target="_blank" href="/shenanigans/nested_cssmenu">multi-layered menus</a>.
			And by that I mean using the least lines of code and resources (CPU/RAM/hard drive space/bandwidth/etc) while utilizing just CSS and plain HTML.
			As a bonus, it includes instructions on <a target="_blank" href="/shenanigans/nested_cssmenu_mobile">how to make it mobile-friendly</a>.
		</li>
		<li><b>2014-02-23:</b>
			The <a target="_blank" href="/shenanigans/datatables_template_generator">dataTables.js template generator</a> is up.
			<br />
			I have just a few basic options/flags up right now (data source, pagination, etc), because <a target="_blank" href="http://datatables.net/ref"> the full list of options</a> for this awesome plugin is ridiculously long.
			<br />
			Eventually, I hope to have have most (if not all) of the possible flags/options up. *cue insane laugh*
			<br />
			My motivation behind this one is mostly convenience and saving time; as with any really extensive plugin, it can be a real pain to get all the formatting right during each initialization/setup. Therefore, this particular page is going to be a long-term project, not just for others', but also for my own convenience.

		I am VeeB and this is my personal website.
		<br /><br />
		What makes this website unique is that it's <b>completely free of image data</b>.
		This includes all conceivable loopholes, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data URIs</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">custom fonts</a>.
		<br /><br />
		You're not hallucinating, it's not a trick of the eyes. Well, actually it kinda is.
		<br /><br />
		What you see is completely free of any image data, GIF, JPEG, BMP or otherwise.
		All of the site's design is done via plain HTML and CSS.
		<br /><br />
		The premise behind this is that, for more complex images, if they can be done programmatically via pure HTML/CSS/Javascript, their programmed versions will almost always be significantly less in size than whatever image format they were in to begin with.
		This is because image formats inherently try to account for each and every single pixel inside the image, while HTML/CSS/Javascript can generalize collections of pixels into much more encompassing rulesets.
		<br /><br />
		Anyway, that's it for my intro for now.
		My next update will be a DataTables.js code generator with all the options as a nice switchboard, kind of like a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/">Colorzilla</a>, but for <a target="_blank" href="https://datatables.net/">DataTables.js</a>.
		After that, I'll get more tutorials going and what not.
